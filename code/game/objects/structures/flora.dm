/*

Plants, trees, etc. If you want to create a plant that can have variations, make sure the .dmi file
has all of the variations with the same prefix and different numbers

Example:
	/obj/structure/flora/plant
		icon_tag = "plant"
		variations = "5"

	when this plant is created, it'll pick one of the five icon states in the dmi file, provided that you have plant_1, plant_3, etc

If you want to make plant cuttable, change it's cut_level var

PLANT_NO_CUT = 1 = Can't be cut down
PLANT_CUT_KNIFE = 2 = Needs at least a bootknife to be cut down
PLANT_CUT_MACHETE = 3 = Needs at least a machete to be cut down

You can also try using different layers, just use two images for one foreground tree, an image of opaque tree will have lower layer than the player and an image that is slightly transparent will have layer higher than the player
I'm using this method to "unhide" people from trees




I get what you mentioned about alpha masking now.
So for you to do that, this is what you would want: 1) Create a plane master for the weather alpha channel. 2) Every area should have black or white icons that render to that plane. 3) Give the plane master a render target starting with an asterisk. 4) Use the alpha plane as a render source for your alpha mask filter on the weather plane that has the particles.
Vallat — 22.07.2021 19:27
I bet I've already tried that, but maybe I incorrectly used render source, let's try, thanks for advise
Hope that will work
Aaand it works
And that was as simple as I expected, thanks Lummox!
The funniest thing is that I was trying to add alpha filter to the weather plane using area as a render source
And was complaining about things not working
